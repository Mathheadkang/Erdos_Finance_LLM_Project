Additionally, the company's political push may be hurting its sales. However, Morgan Stanley's reinstatement of TSLA as its top U.S. auto pick suggests that the company's focus on artificial intelligence and robotics may be a positive factor. Overall, I would recommend a \"hold\" rating for TSLA, as the company's challenges and uncertainties outweigh its potential positives....\n"
