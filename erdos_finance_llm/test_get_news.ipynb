       "  'summary': 'Apple\\'s (AAPL) recent teaser on social media from CEO Tim Cook, with the cryptic message \"there\\'s something in the air,\" has many speculating about new products on the horizon. To shed light on what this might mean, TechRadar Editor-at-Large Lance Ulanoff joins Asking for a Trend host Josh Lipton to share his insight into the potential devices Apple could release. \"We\\'ve certainly been hearing rumors about the MacBook Air featuring the M4 chip for quite a while,\" Ulanoff says, explaining that the chip\\'s debut in other Apple products makes it the perfect time for the MacBook Air to get the update. On Apple\\'s artificial intelligence (AI) efforts, Ulanoff critiques their progress, giving the tech company a grade of a B-: \"Look, this has been incredibly frustrating. You\\'ve got to think back, too. Apple was a leader right? It was Siri. They were first with Siri. It was actually before Alexa,right? And then Alexa came out and it became more popular as the digital assistant — and Siri kind of trundled along, got some brain transplants, has gotten incrementally better over the years. \"But now in the AI space, right in in the AI revolution, we have three month update cycles, and we have been waiting a very long, like ten-month period, for Apple to fully deliver the thing they promised,\" Ulanoff adds.

       "  'summary': 'Apple\\'s (AAPL) recent teaser on social media from CEO Tim Cook, with the cryptic message \"there\\'s something in the air,\" has many speculating about new products on the horizon. To shed light on what this might mean, TechRadar Editor-at-Large Lance Ulanoff joins Asking for a Trend host Josh Lipton to share his insight into the potential devices Apple could release. \"We\\'ve certainly been hearing rumors about the MacBook Air featuring the M4 chip for quite a while,\" Ulanoff says, explaining that the chip\\'s debut in other Apple products makes it the perfect time for the MacBook Air to get the update. On Apple\\'s artificial intelligence (AI) efforts, Ulanoff critiques their progress, giving the tech company a grade of a B-: \"Look, this has been incredibly frustrating. You\\'ve got to think back, too. Apple was a leader right? It was Siri. They were first with Siri. It was actually before Alexa,right? And then Alexa came out and it became more popular as the digital assistant — and Siri kind of trundled along, got some brain transplants, has gotten incrementally better over the years. \"But now in the AI space, right in in the AI revolution, we have three month update cycles, and we have been waiting a very long, like ten-month period, for Apple to fully deliver the thing they promised,\" Ulanoff adds.
